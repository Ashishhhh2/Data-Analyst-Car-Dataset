# Car Dataset Analysis
This project explores a dataset of various car models to uncover insights about pricing, performance, fuel efficiency, and manufacturing origins. It uses Python and pandas for data manipulation, with visualizations powered by seaborn and matplotlib.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes detailed specifications for each car, such as:

Make: Manufacturer (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Ford)

Model: Specific model name

Type: Vehicle type (SUV, Sedan, etc.)

Origin: Region of manufacture (Asia, Europe, USA)

DriveTrain: Type of drivetrain (Front, Rear, All)

MSRP: Manufacturer's suggested retail price

Invoice: Dealer invoice price

EngineSize, Cylinders, Horsepower

MPG_City, MPG_Highway: Fuel efficiency

Weight, Wheelbase, Length

# Key Questions Explored
What are the most common car manufacturers?

How many cars originate from Asia or Europe?

Which cars have missing values, and how can they be handled?

What are the most fuel-efficient cars?

Which cars weigh more than 4000 lbs?

How does MPG_City change when increased by a fixed value?

# Technologies Used
Python 

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

# Sample Insights
Toyota is the most frequent car make in the dataset.

Cars from Asia and Europe dominate the dataset.

Missing values in the Cylinders column were filled using the mean.

Cars with weight above 4000 lbs were filtered out for specific analysis.

Fuel efficiency (MPG_City) was increased by 3 units across all records for simulation.
